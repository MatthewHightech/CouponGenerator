# Coupon Generator

### Purpose

After interviewing for an internship, I was interested in learning more about this company's tech stack. When talking to them about it they mentioned some tools I had not used and so I decided to learn more.

From my experience, there is no better way to learn a new skill than jumping right into the deep end and building a full-stack web app packed with them!

Welcome to Coupon Generator. A simple playground for testing new full-stack development tools üõù

### Outcome

Upon developing this project in a condensed period of 4 days, I have been able to familiarize myself with the following tools.

- [NextJS](https://nextjs.org/)
- [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/)
- [Prisma](https://www.prisma.io/)
- [GraphQL](https://graphql.org/)
- [Nexus GraphQL Schemas](https://nexusjs.org/)
- [Apollo GraphQL](https://www.apollographql.com/)
- [Vercel Deploymenmt](https://vercel.com/docs/deployments/environments)

I hope you too can benifit from either peaking around in a simple implementation of many of these tools, or just feel inspired to start a learning mission of your own üöÄ



## Want To Run it Yourself?

First, clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/MatthewHightech/CouponGenerator.git
```

Next, install the required packages from within the repository:

```bash
npm i
```

Last, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

To connect a database, you will have to set one up and copy the URI into a `.env` file under the name `MONGODB_URI`

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.


## Learn More

To learn more about Next.js, take a look at the following resources:

- [Next.js Documentation](https://nextjs.org/docs) - learn about Next.js features and API.

## Deploy on Vercel

The easiest way to deploy your Next.js app is to use the [Vercel Platform](https://vercel.com/new?utm_medium=default-template&filter=next.js&utm_source=create-next-app&utm_campaign=create-next-app-readme) from the creators of Next.js.

Check out our [Next.js deployment documentation](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/deploying) for more details.
